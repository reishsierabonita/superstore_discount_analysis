# <h1> Superstore Discount Analysis </h>

#### Introduction:
As part of the "Creating Dashboards and Storytelling with Tableau" course in Coursera, I've created an analysis to answer a business question:
<p>Are discounted orders more or less profitable than non-discounted orders? </p>

#### Project Scope:
This Story Points presentation effectively answers the business question by presenting a clear narrative supported by well-designed visualizations. 
It aligns with the board's needs for actionable insights and demonstrates the impact of discounts on profitability. 
The design choices reflect the specific needs of the audience, ensuring a compelling and informative presentation for the stakeholders.
